; Need to waste ~40 inst/us (for 40MIPS) and since assembly loop takes 5
; instructions, it should be repeated 8 times to elapse a us. Since temp is a
; 16-bit word, the maximum delay possible is ~8.2ms (time=8192).
_delay_us:

; The inner loop, modelled after the _delay_us routine, is repeated "time"
; times wasting 1ms per iteration (1000us * 8 - 2 = 7998).
